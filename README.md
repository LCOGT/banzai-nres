## The line list
Included in banzai_nres/data is the ThAr_atlas_ESO_original_air.txt which was fetched from
http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/uves/tools/tharatlas.html on August 27 2020.

These lines were converted to vacuum wavelength using the original 1966 Edlen Equation (Bengt Edl√©n 1966 Metrologia 2 71, 
https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/2/2/002) for the index of refraction of air. 
We use this equation because the ThAr atlas contains wavelengths that were originally vacuum wavelengths, which were then 
converted to air wavelengths using the original 1966 Edlen Equation (NEED CITATION / VERIFY THIS IS CORRECT)
 
 The Edlen Equation that we used is 
banzai_nres.utils.wavelength_utils.index_of_refraction_Edlen . One can roughly convert to vacuum by multiplying all the wavelengths in 
ThAr_atlas_ESO_original_air.txt by the index of refraction at each line's AIR wavelength. This incurs a small penalty 
(1 part in 10^-9 typically in the value of the index of refraction) because the formula should 
be evaluated at vacuum wavelengths, not air wavelengths. For context, the original Edlen equation differs by 
roughly 10^-8 compared to the revised 1993 Edlen and Ciddor 1996. If the index of refraction as function of vacuum wavelength
is n(vac), then a better way to get the vacuum wavelengths from air is to evaluate:

wavelength_vacuum = wavelength_air * n(wavelength_air * n(wavelength_air))   (Eq. 1)

Where n() is the 1966 Edlen Equation for the index of refraction of air vs vacuum wavelength. 
We use Eq. 1 to convert from the ThAr_atlas_ESO_original_air.txt original air
wavelengths to vacuum wavelengths. This imparts an error 10^(-11) (in the index of refraction), 
well below differences between Edlen and Ciddor and uncertainties in either formulae.

The resulting vacuum list, which is used by this pipeline 
to calibrate the spectrographs, is banzai_nres/data/ThAr_atlas_ESO_vacuum.txt


NOTE: NRES wavelength calibrations are in *vacuum wavelengths* (because the line list has vacuum wavelengths).
