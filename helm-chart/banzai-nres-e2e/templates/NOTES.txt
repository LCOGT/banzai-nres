This chart runs the end-to-end tests for the BANZAI-NRES pipeline.

This creates one rabbitmq instance to simulate the Fits Exchange and a Redis instance to act as a task queue.
There are 2 other banzai containers, the listener and the worker containers.

The chart pulls a docker image with test data that it then copies into the pod, so initialization of
the pod can take a significant amount of time.

See https://github.com/lcogt/banzai-nres for the code and documentation.
